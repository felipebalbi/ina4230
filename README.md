# INA4230 Rust Device Driver

A `#[no_std]` platform-agnostic driver for the [INA4230](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina4230.pdf)
48 V quad-channel current, voltage, power, and energy monitor, based on the
[`embedded-hal`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal) traits.

## Design

The driver is split into a pure core and a thin shell.

**`units` and `convert`** hold every physical quantity, the validated
calibration inputs, and all the register decoding. They have no bus, no
`async`, no HAL dependency, and no floating-point arithmetic, so they build and
test on the host as readily as on the target. This is where the thinking lives,
and where the tests are.

**`Ina4230`** is the shell. Each method moves bytes to or from the device and
hands them to a pure function. It contains no arithmetic.

Measurements are returned as newtypes over integers, in whichever unit keeps
the conversion from the raw register *exact*:

| Type           | Unit | Rendering methods                    |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| `ShuntVoltage` | nV   | `to_millivolts`                      |
| `BusVoltage`   | µV   | `to_millivolts`, `to_volts`          |
| `Current`      | nA   | `to_milliamps`, `to_amps`            |
| `Power`        | nW   | `to_milliwatts`, `to_watts`          |
| `Energy`       | nJ   | `to_millijoules`, `to_joules`        |

`f32` appears only in those `to_*` methods. They are for display; do arithmetic
on the integer accessors (`as_nanovolts`, `as_microamps`, and friends), which
are lossless.

## Features

- Full register coverage via a pre-generated `src/device.rs`, built from
  `INA4230.ddsl` with `device-driver-cli` and checked in sync by CI
- Async-first I²C interface (`embedded-hal-async`)
- Four independent measurement channels (bus voltage, shunt voltage, current,
  power, energy)
- Per-channel calibration with independent shunt resistor, current resolution,
  and ADC range
- Optional `defmt` logging support

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
ina4230 = "0.1.0"
embedded-hal-async = "1"
```

```rust,ignore
use ina4230::{
    AdcRange, AddrPinState, AddressPins, Calibration, Channel, CurrentLsb,
    CurrentSensor, Ina4230, ShuntResistance, VoltageSensor,
};

// i2c implements embedded_hal_async::i2c::I2c
let mut sensor = Ina4230::new(i2c, AddressPins {
    a0: AddrPinState::Gnd,
    a1: AddrPinState::Gnd,
});

// Calibration is validated up front, away from the bus.
let cal = Calibration::new(
    CurrentLsb::from_nanoamps(500_000)?,      // 500 µA/LSB
    ShuntResistance::from_microohms(8_000)?,  // 8 mΩ
    AdcRange::Range0,
)?;

sensor.reset().await?;
sensor.calibrate(Channel::Ch1, cal).await?;

// Wait for a conversion. See the note on reading flags below.
while !sensor.read_flags().await?.conversion_ready() {}

let bus = sensor.bus_voltage(Channel::Ch1).await?;
let current = sensor.current(Channel::Ch1).await?;

defmt::info!("{} mV, {} mA", bus.to_millivolts(), current.to_milliamps());
```

## Configuration

Two hardware-specific parameters are needed per channel, plus a choice of ADC
range. All three are checked once, when the `Calibration` is built; nothing
downstream re-checks them.

### Shunt resistance

The resistance of the shunt fitted on that channel, in microohms:

```rust
# use ina4230::ShuntResistance;
let shunt = ShuntResistance::from_microohms(8_000)?; // 8 mΩ
# Ok::<(), ina4230::CalibrationError>(())
```

Use a precision resistor (0.1% tolerance or better). For very low values, use
Kelvin (4-wire) connections to eliminate lead resistance errors.

### Current resolution

`CURRENT_LSB` sets the resolution of the current measurement. Smaller gives
finer resolution and a lower full-scale range; larger gives a wider range and
coarser resolution.

Datasheet Equation 2 gives the minimum as `MAX_CURRENT / 2^15`:

```rust
# use ina4230::CurrentLsb;
// For a 10 A maximum: 305_176 nA/LSB.
let minimum = CurrentLsb::min_for_max_current(10_000_000_000)?;
# Ok::<(), ina4230::CalibrationError>(())
```

That is a floor, not a recommendation. Equation 2 divides by 2^15 = 32768 while
the `CURRENT` register saturates at 32767, so the minimum lands about 0.003%
below the requested full scale. The datasheet expects you to round up to a
convenient number — its worked example takes a 305.17578 µA minimum for 10 A
and uses 500 µA — and permits up to eight times the minimum before resolution
suffers. Rounding up also closes the gap.

### ADC range

| `AdcRange`         | Full-scale range | LSB    |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------ |
| `Range0` (default) | ±81.92 mV        | 2.5 µV |
| `Range1`           | ±20.48 mV        | 625 nV |

`Range0` suits most applications. Use `Range1` for higher resolution when
measuring small currents through a large shunt. Selecting `Range1` divides
`SHUNT_CAL` by 4 and adjusts the shunt LSB automatically; `CONFIG2.RANGE` is
written to hardware when the channel is calibrated.

### Calibration

The calibration register tells the device the shunt value used to derive
current from the measured differential voltage, and sets the resolution of the
current, power, and energy registers.

```rust
# use ina4230::{AdcRange, Calibration, CurrentLsb, ShuntResistance};
let cal = Calibration::new(
    CurrentLsb::from_nanoamps(500_000)?,
    ShuntResistance::from_microohms(8_000)?,
    AdcRange::Range0,
)?;
assert_eq!(cal.shunt_cal().as_u16(), 1280); // datasheet §8.2.2.3
# Ok::<(), ina4230::CalibrationError>(())
```

Building a `Calibration` is the only fallible step in configuring the device.
It reports `ShuntCalOverflow` or `ShuntCalUnderflow` rather than silently
clamping, and rejects a `SHUNT_CAL` of zero because the device then reports
zero current indefinitely (datasheet §8.1.2).

Call `calibrate()` before reading current, power, or energy. Bus voltage does
not require it; shunt voltage does, because its scale depends on the ADC range.
Each channel is independent, and `calibrate_all()` programs all four with a
single `CONFIG2` update.

Calibration must be reprogrammed after power-up, a power cycle, a device
enable, or a `reset()`. `reset()` clears the driver's cached calibration to
match, so a subsequent measurement fails with `NotCalibrated` rather than
returning a confidently wrong number.

### Channel management

All four channels are active after power-up. Unused channels can be disabled to
shorten the conversion cycle:

```rust,ignore
sensor.set_channel_active(Channel::Ch3, false).await?;
```

## Reading flags

`read_flags()` returns the whole `FLAGS` register:

```rust,ignore
let flags = sensor.read_flags().await?;
if flags.math_overflow() {
    warn!("current and power data may be invalid");
}
if flags.any_energy_overflow() {
    warn!("energy accumulator overflowed");
}
```

**This read is destructive.** Reading `FLAGS` clears the conversion-ready flag
and the latched alert flags (datasheet Table 7-20). There is no way to poll one
bit without consuming the others, which is why the API returns the whole
register instead of offering per-bit accessors that would quietly discard the
rest. If you poll for conversion completion in a loop, be aware that you are
also discarding any overflow raised in the meantime.

## Error handling

`Ina4230Error` is small on purpose: overflow conditions are reported through
`Flags`, not as errors, because an error can carry only one of them.

```rust,ignore
match sensor.current(Channel::Ch1).await {
    Ok(i) => info!("{} mA", i.to_milliamps()),
    Err(Ina4230Error::NotCalibrated(ch)) => error!("calibrate {:?} first", ch),
    Err(Ina4230Error::Bus(e)) => error!("I²C error: {:?}", e),
}
```

`NotCalibrated` is detected before any bus traffic is generated.

## I²C addresses

The address is selected by the A0 and A1 pin strapping. `AddressPins` uses
named fields because both are the same type and a transposed pair yields a
valid-looking but wrong address:

```rust
# use ina4230::{AddrPinState, Address, AddressPins};
let addr = Address::from_pins(AddressPins {
    a0: AddrPinState::Gnd,
    a1: AddrPinState::Sda,
});
assert_eq!(addr.as_u8(), 0x48);
```

Datasheet Table 6-1 is a regular encoding, `0x40 | (A1 << 2) | A0`, with
`GND = 0`, `VS = 1`, `SDA = 2`, `SCL = 3`:

| A1  | A0  | Address | A1  | A0  | Address |
| --- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | ------- |
| GND | GND | `0x40`  | SDA | GND | `0x48`  |
| GND | VS  | `0x41`  | SDA | VS  | `0x49`  |
| GND | SDA | `0x42`  | SDA | SDA | `0x4A`  |
| GND | SCL | `0x43`  | SDA | SCL | `0x4B`  |
| VS  | GND | `0x44`  | SCL | GND | `0x4C`  |
| VS  | VS  | `0x45`  | SCL | VS  | `0x4D`  |
| VS  | SDA | `0x46`  | SCL | SDA | `0x4E`  |
| VS  | SCL | `0x47`  | SCL | SCL | `0x4F`  |

Note the column order: A1 first, matching the datasheet.

## Not yet implemented

The following are described in `INA4230.ddsl` and reachable in the generated
register layer, but have no high-level API yet:

- **Alert configuration** (`ALERT_CONFIG1..4`, addresses `0x07`, `0x0F`,
  `0x17`, `0x1F`). Selects the alert function — shunt over/under limit, bus
  over/under limit, power over limit — and the channel it applies to.
  Encodings 6 and 7 are reserved, so the generated conversion is fallible.
- **Alert limits** (`ALERT_LIMIT1..4`, addresses `0x06`, `0x0E`, `0x16`,
  `0x1E`). The register format follows the alert function it is paired with:
  signed for shunt limits, unsigned for bus and power. Making that
  reinterpretation safe is the interesting part of the design, and the reason
  it is not simply a `u16` setter.
- **`CONFIG2` alert behaviour**: `CNVR_MASK`, `ENOF_MASK`, `ALERT_LATCH`, and
  `ALERT_POL`.
- **`CONFIG1` timing**: `AVG`, `VBUSCT`, and `VSHCT`. The power-on defaults
  (1 sample, 1.1 ms conversion times, continuous shunt and bus) are used.
- **Energy accumulator reset** (`CONFIG2.ACC_RST`), which also clears the
  energy overflow flags.
- **`SMBus` Alert Response** (address `0b0001100`) and **General Call reset**
  (`0x00`, `0x06`), both supported by the device.

The `FLAGS` register already exposes the four alert-limit bits via
`Flags::limit_alerts()`, so alert conditions are observable even though they
cannot yet be configured through this crate.
